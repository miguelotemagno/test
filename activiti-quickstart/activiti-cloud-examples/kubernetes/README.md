## Kubernetes

If you've never used kubernetes before, go to the kubectl option.

If you've used kubernetes, have an AWS cluster to use and are interested in package management and versioning, go to helm.

If you want to use kubernetes on AWS but haven't done so, go to 'onaws'.

If you're using another kind of platform with kubernetes (e.g. GCP) and want to deploy Activiti, the AWS deployment instructions should work with some modification (please give us feedback).
